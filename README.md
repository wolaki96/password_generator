## Random Password Generator
This project creates a random password so that you may use a secure, unique, random password for your logins.

## Creation
I created this project using JavaScript imbedded into HTML and CSS. 
This was my first project that I created in JavaScript. I began by naming the variables, then creating the if/else statements for the text windows, and completed the project using a Math.Random for loop.
In the future I would like to brush up the code to make sure that all the selected features show up regardless of characters chosen.

## How To Use
To work this project, click "Generate Password" button. There will be a series of prompts that ask what characters you would like to have in your generated password. After all the prompts have channeled through, your new random password will appear. If you do not like the password given, you can push "Generate Password" again and get a new one by going through the prompts again.
